                Library that will allow generating ready-made elements from javascript objects will significantly speed up and simplify front-end development.

	           This library will generate HTML tags, styles and events. To generate content on web page can be used an empty div by specifying its id to library. Library functionality is divided into functions available to the user and hidden functions / objects. Using the ‘oform’ keyword will give access to an object that contains links to user-accessible functions, which in turn also return objects with links to other functions. Thus the user can create a chain of public functions with which he can customize the content generator.
